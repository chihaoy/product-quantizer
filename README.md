# Product Quantizer
This project is a C++ implementation of Product quantizer for nearest neighbor search.


### Compile and Install
This project can be compiled with GCC 3.8 or later under Linux and MacOS. Although no test has been made on Windows, 
it should be compiled smoothly on Windows by MinGW with a few modifications. 

```
cd product-quantizer/
make release
cp bin/Release/pq $HOME/bin
```

$${\color{red}Clearer\space Steps:}$$

Need to download matlab so that we can convert fvecs and ivecs file to txt file(used for comparison between generated results and grounded truth results)


Unpack the siftsmall dataset:

```
cd data
wget ftp://ftp.irisa.fr/local/texmex/corpus/siftsmall.tar.gz
tar zxvf siftsmall.tar.gz
```
All operations can be done in bin -> Release folder ( pq-tc.conf,pq-ec.conf,pq-nc.conf and itm_pq_sift_base.tx are provided)


get.py:used to compare between txt file for generated files and txt file of grounded truth results(currently only support siftsmall)


and recall.txt shows the recall rate for each vector(100 in total, last line shows overall recall rate, result.txt:from the NN search, correct.txt grounded truth(convert from ivecs file)



cd into bin -> Release folder(make sure to adjust path for siftsmall data)
```
./pq -vc siftsmall_learn.fvecs -k 1024 -d 2.2.txt

./pq -tc pq-tc.conf -s siftsmall_learn.fvecs -k 256 -m 8 -o ivfpq -d 2.4.pq

./pq -ec pq-ec.conf -i itm_pq_sift_base.txt -o ivfpq

./pq -nc pq-nc.conf -o pqa -q siftsmall_query.fvecs -d result.txt
```
